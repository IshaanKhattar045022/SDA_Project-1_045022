# OBJECTIVES AND INFERENCES

**1.	Population Distribution by Country:**

**_Objective_**_
This chart showcases the population distribution across various South Asian countries, providing a clear view of how each nation contributes to the region's total population.

**_Interpretation_**
The chart highlights India's overwhelming dominance in the region's population, with Pakistan and Bangladesh contributing significantly smaller shares. Meanwhile, countries like Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Maldives have minimal representation, showcasing the stark disparity in population sizes within South Asia. This visualization emphasizes the demographic weight of India compared to its neighbors, offering insights into regional dynamics that could influence policies, resource allocation, and development planning.


**2.	Mortality Rate Over the Years:**

 **_Objective:_** 
This graph presents the changes in infant mortality rates (measured as deaths per 1,000 live births) over consecutive five-year intervals from 2000 to 2025. It aims to provide a clear visual representation of the progress made in reducing infant mortality over the years, highlighting the effectiveness of public health initiatives and policies.  

**_Interpretation:_**
The graph indicates a steady and significant decline in infant mortality rates across the observed periods. This downward trend suggests substantial improvements in healthcare services, including better access to prenatal and postnatal care, advancements in medical technology, enhanced nutrition, and improvements in hygiene and living conditions. The reduction underscores the success of targeted efforts to improve child health outcomes globally.


**3.	GDP Distribution by Country:**
 
**_Objective:_**
This graph visualizes the GDP distribution across various countries in South Asia and parts of Southeast Asia, using a heatmap-style color scale to indicate economic output. The map highlights which countries have the highest and lowest GDP regarding current US dollars.

**_Interpretation:_**
The map uses a color gradient, where darker shades represent higher GDP levels. For instance, India, shown in darker blue and green shades, indicates a significant economic presence compared to its neighbors. In contrast, countries like Sri Lanka are shaded in dark blue, reflecting lower GDP figures relative to India and surrounding nations. Overall, this visual representation emphasizes economic disparities in the region, illustrating how wealth is distributed unevenly across neighboring countries.

**4.	Mortality Trends by Region:**

**_Objective:_** 
This chart aims to illustrate infant mortality rate trends across different South Asian countries over several decades, highlighting progress or concerns in health outcomes. It uses a line graph to show the decline or stability of infant mortality rates over time.

**_Interpretation:_**
The graph reveals a general downward trend in infant mortality rates from 2000 to 2030 across all countries, indicating improvements in healthcare and living conditions. Afghanistan, marked in blue, starts with a higher mortality rate, but it also shows significant improvement over the years. Countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives, with relatively lower initial rates, continue to experience steady declines. This visual emphasizes the progress in reducing infant deaths but also underscores the variation between countries in the pace of improvement.

**5.	Yearly Unemployment Rate (%) Over Time**:

**_Objective:_**
The chart depicts changes in the yearly unemployment rate as a percentage of the total labor force over time, highlighting trends and notable shifts in job market conditions.

**_Interpretation:_** 
The graph initially shows a relatively stable unemployment rate from 2000 to 2007, followed by a sharp decline around 2008. However, there is a dramatic spike in unemployment from 2009 to 2011, possibly indicating an economic crisis or major labor market disruption. After this peak, the unemployment rate dropped drastically in 2012 and then stabilized at a significantly lower level through 2024. This pattern suggests a period of economic recovery or job market stabilization following an earlier period of turmoil.


**6.	Infant Mortality Rate Over the Years:**

**_Objective:_**  
The chart's purpose is to illustrate the trend of infant mortality rates over the years, highlighting how this critical health indicator has evolved from 2000 to 2024.

**_Interpretation:_**
The shaded area graph shows a steady decline in infant mortality rates, indicating consistent improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living standards. Starting from a high rate of over 450 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000, the rate has significantly decreased by 2024. This downward trend signifies progress in medical interventions, better maternal health practices, and enhanced access to healthcare services, reflecting positive strides in child survival and overall public health advancements.

**7.	Relationship Between GDP and Infant Mortality Rate Across Countries:**

**_Objective:_**
This scatter plot aims to show the relationship between a country’s GDP (in current US dollars) and its infant mortality rate, highlighting how economic strength correlates with health outcomes across different nations.

**_Interpretation:_**
The graph generally suggests a negative correlation: as GDP increases, the infant mortality rate tends to decrease. Countries with lower GDPs, like Afghanistan and Nepal, appear on the left with higher infant mortality rates, while wealthier nations like Sri Lanka and Maldives are further right, indicating lower rates. The spread across the plot highlights the disparity in economic and health conditions, demonstrating that greater economic resources are often associated with better health outcomes. However, the data also show variations within this trend, indicating that GDP is not the only factor influencing infant mortality rates.


**8.	Regional Disparities in Health Outcomes:**

**_Objective:**_   
This scatter plot is designed to depict the relationship between life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rates across various countries, aiming to highlight regional disparities in health outcomes.

**_Interpretation:_**   
The chart reveals a clear inverse relationship which is- as life expectancy increases, infant mortality rates decrease. Countries like Afghanistan and Nepal, positioned on the left with lower life expectancy, have higher infant mortality rates, while countries such as Sri Lanka and the Maldives, on the right with higher life expectancy, enjoy significantly lower infant mortality. The clustering of data points by country color visually emphasizes the health disparities, with some nations performing far better than others in terms of these critical health metrics. This underscores the impact of overall health infrastructure and living standards on child and adult well-being.

**9.	 Life Expectancy by Region:**

**_Objective:_** 
The map aims to depict life expectancy across different regions in South Asia, using a color gradient to represent variations in average life expectancy at birth.

**_Interpretation:_**  
The color scale illustrates life expectancy, with darker shades indicating lower values and lighter shades showing higher ones. India and its neighboring countries are displayed with different shades, suggesting variations in life expectancy across the region. For example, countries like Sri Lanka, shaded in a lighter color, have higher life expectancy rates, while darker shades in countries like Afghanistan highlight lower average life spans. This visual representation underscores the regional disparities in health and longevity, likely reflecting differences in healthcare quality, nutrition, and socioeconomic factors.

**10.	Unemployment Rates vs. Life Expectancy at Birth in 2020**

**_Objective:_**
This graph aims to show the relationship between unemployment rates and life expectancy at birth in 2020 across eight South Asian countries.

**_Interpretations:_**
Overall, there seems to be a slight negative correlation between unemployment rates and life expectancy. Countries with lower unemployment rates tend to have higher life expectancies, and vice versa. However, the relationship is not very strong, and there are exceptions to the trend. For example, Afghanistan has a relatively high unemployment rate but a low life expectancy. This could be due to various factors, such as conflict, poverty, and healthcare access.
